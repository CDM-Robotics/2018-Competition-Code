    /**
     *  The PWM signal used to control the Victor SP should be between 1-2ms in duration
     *  with a center (neutral) pulse of 1.5ms and a period between 2.9-100ms.
     *  The PWM period is how fast the robot controller can send a new PWM pulse.
     *  The amount of time between the rising edge of one PWM pulse to the next PWM pulse
     *  should not be less than 2.9ms or greater than 100ms.
     *
     *  Calibration
     *  The calibration of a Victor SP is essentially the scale of PWM input signal to output voltage.
     *  Different controllers may have different “max” and “min” PWM signals that may not correspond
     *  to the same Victor SP outputs. Calibrating the Victor SP allows it to adjust for these
     *  differences so that a “max” signal results in a “max” output.
     *  Calibrating can also correct issues caused by joysticks or gamepads with off-center neutral outputs.
     *  The Victor SP’s default calibration is compatible with the roboRIO control system
     *
     *  Brake & Coast Modes
     *  When a neutral PWM signal is applied to the Victor SP in Brake mode, the motor will resist rotation,
     *  especially high speed rotation. This is accomplished by essentially shorting the motor leads, which
     *  causes a Back Electromotive Force (Back-EMF) to resist the rotation of the motor.
     *  Brake mode does not have any effect when the motor is not rotating, but can make a large difference
     *  in robot behavior when used on a motor attached to a high reduction gearbox.
     *  Brake mode does not impact performance when a non-neutral PWM signal is applied.
     *  When a neutral PWM signal is applied to the Victor SP in Coast mode,
     *  Back-EMF will not be generated, so the motor’s rotation will not be affected by the Victor SP.
     *
     *  Switching between Brake & Coast: To switch between Brake and Coast mode,
     *  simply push the B/C CAL button at any time.
     *  The Victor SP is in
     *      Brake mode when the button is illuminated red and
     *      Coast when the red light is turned off.
     *  Brake/Coast settings are saved even if power is removed from the Victor SP.
     *
     * Note that the VictorSP uses the following bounds for PWM values.
     * These values should work reasonably well for most controllers, but if users experience issues
     * such as asymmetric behavior around the deadband or inability to saturate the controller in
     * either direction, calibration is recommended.
     * The calibration procedure can be found in the VictorSP User Manual available from CTRE.
     * - 2.004ms = full "forward"
     * - 1.52ms = the "high end" of the deadband range
     * - 1.50ms = center of the deadband range (off)
     * - 1.48ms = the "low end" of the deadband range
     * - .997ms = full "reverse"
     *
     * ctor channel - The PWM channel that the VictorSP is attached to. 0-9 are on-board, 10-19 are on the MXP port
